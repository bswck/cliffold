## towncrier

```
Usage: towncrier [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Towncrier is a utility to produce useful, summarised news files for your
  project. Rather than reading the Git history as some newer tools to produce
  it, or having one single file which developers all write to, towncrier reads
  "news fragments" which contain information useful to end users.

  Towncrier delivers the news which is convenient to those that hear it, not
  those that write it.

  That is, a “news fragment” (a small file containing just enough information
  to be useful to end users) can be written that summarises what has changed
  from the “developer log” (which may contain complex information about the
  original issue, how it was fixed, who authored the fix, and who reviewed the
  fix). By compiling a collection of these fragments, towncrier can produce a
  digest of the changes which is valuable to those who may wish to use the
  software.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build*  Build a combined news file from news fragment.
  check   Check for new fragments on a branch.
  create  Create a new news fragment.
```

  -n, --no-interaction       Do not ask any interactive question.
      --no-plugins           Disables plugins.
      --no-cache             Disables Poetry source caches.
